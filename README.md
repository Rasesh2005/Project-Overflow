## The one-stop destination for project ideas for jobs, hackathons. Users can get access to relevant resources, tutorials, 

### Problem
Getting a good project idea can be a difficult task, we have to do a lot of research , think of a good problem, use the best relevant techstack, do a lot of research about its feasibility and many more stuffs. This is a very complicated task. 

## Let us solve problems like covid19, vaccination drive problem with the skills we know. 
Right now, you can get project ideas:
➜ on random topics,
➜ according to a problem theme like covid19, vaccine distribution etc,
➜ to put on job resume,
➜ using data structures and algorithms
More features are coming soon :)
