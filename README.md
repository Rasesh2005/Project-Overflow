**It is a website which is like a one-stop destination for project ideas (jobs, hackathons, personal projects, themetical projects like rural education, farming, covid19, vaccination distribution problem ).**

### Problem it solves
Getting a good project idea can be a difficult task, we have to do a lot of research , think of a good problem, use the best relevant techstack,and many more stuffs. This is a very complicated task. Even after finding a project, we have to research more to find the learning resources, tutorials, user flow etc. This is the problem which most of the developers face. So Project overflow will be an initiative **to help people find good projects which solve a real life problem.**

## Let us solve ðŸ’¡ problems like covid19, vaccination drive problem with the skills we know. 
Right now, you can get project ideas:
âžœ on random topics,
âžœ according to a problem theme like covid19, vaccine distribution etc,
âžœ to put on job resume,
âžœ using data structures and algorithms
 We will be working together to add more features to the Project :)
 
 
 

## Technologies  we will explore while developing  this project
Web development
Machine Learning
Augmented Reallity
Cloud Computing
User Interface Designing and development
User Experience Designing and development
APIs (Application Programming Inteface)

may be some more :)
